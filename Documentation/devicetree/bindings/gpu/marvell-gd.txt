* Marvell 2D Graphics Accelerator

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "mrvl, xxx" for SoCs:
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  SoC reference manual
- interrupts : Should contain the VPU interrupt. For CODA960,
  a second interrupt is needed for the MJPEG unit.
- clocks : Should contain the ahb and per clocks, in the order
  determined by the clock-names property.
- clock-names : Should be "ahb", "per"
- iram : phandle pointing to the SRAM device node

Example:
gpu: gpu@C0400000 {
	compatible = "marvell,gpu";
	reg = <0xC0400000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 8 0x4>;
	status = "disabled";
};

gpu2d {
	compatible = "marvell,gpu2d";
	status = "disabled";
};
