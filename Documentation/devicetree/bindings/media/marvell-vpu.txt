* Marvell codec

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "mrvl, mmp-xxx" for SoCs:
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  SoC reference manual
- interrupts : Should contain the VPU interrupt. For CODA960,
  a second interrupt is needed for the MJPEG unit.
- clocks : Should contain the ahb and per clocks, in the order
  determined by the clock-names property.
- clock-names : Should be "ahb", "per"
- iram : phandle pointing to the SRAM device node

Example:
coda7542: coda7542@d420d000 {
	compatible = "mrvl,mmp-coda7542";
	reg = <0xd420d000 0x1000>,
	      <0xd1004000 0x11600>;
	interrupts = <0 25 0x4>;
	marvell,power-domain = <&pd_vpu>;
	status = "disabled";
};
